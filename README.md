A collection of scripts for provisioning a virtualized dev environment.

## Background

Like any other geek, you'll see a smile on my face when someone hands me a new laptop.  But like most other geeks, I'm not truly happy with that new laptop 'till I can tweek it to suit my needs.  What's not so cool is the slow and laborious process of manually configuring a laptop to support my current dev environment. 

Being a full-time [DevOps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) believer and part-time practioner, I've decided to put together this repository to help simplify the provisioning process.

## The Toolbox

* Some shell scripts
* [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-open-source/)
